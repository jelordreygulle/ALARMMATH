This is an alarm clock + mathematics application (ALARMMATH) android app.
If you wanted to use and run the code then you need to figure out the modification
i've set including the java class and the xml files. If you are really passionate in 
developing android apps or knowledge about debugging then you could figure
the whole code out and then you can try to modify it if you want. In real life not
everything is a piece of cake , that is why i've modify it so that if you wanted
to run and use it then you'll also learn on how to debug the changes i've set.
You can't just copy it and then run it , you need to set blah blah about it. You'll
know it if you try it.
